<h2>Installation:</h2>

<hr>
<ul>
<li />LED cost on the installation (ceiling light covering)
<li />dimension of the space to know how many LEDs are needed
<li />density of LEDs (how ma<p></p>ny in x, y, z axis)
<li />types of lighting (LEDs: RGB, miniature, bi-color, strips; (UV) fiber optics, fiberglass; light blub)
<li />idea of using optical fibers alone or to link the LEDs (with the Muse)
<li />individual LEDs vs. strips or existing systems

<h4>To-do/Find:</h4>
<li />the dimensional spacing between LEDs currently to figure out cost
<li />what the power consumption is per “x” LED and as a matrix at the moment
<li />if not using the Cube, create blueprint drawings of light tubing to max/min lightwave length and to manipulate brightness
<li />submit a drawing of a modular LED matrix design and a section that can pop a kinetic (submit sometime next week)
<li />scout unique, applicable LEDs samples from Creatron
ask MeU friend if we can borrow a LED singular plane matrix to observe structure on energy efficiency 
</ul>
